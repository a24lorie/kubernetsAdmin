### Introduction

ConfigMaps are a type of Kubernetes Resource that is used to decouple configuration artifacts from container image content to keep containerized applications portable. The configuration data is stored as key-value pairs. One ConfigMap may contain one or more key-value pairs. With  `kubectl`, ConfigMaps can be created from:

-   Environment variable files consisting of key-value pairs separated by equal signs, e.g.  `key=value`. The file should have one key-value pair per line.
-   Regular files or directories of files which results in keys that are the names of the files and values that are the contents of the files.
-   Literals consisting of individual key-value pairs that you specify on the command line.
-   Writing a YAML manifest file of  `kind: ConfigMap`.

ConfigMaps can be mounted into containers as volumes or as environment variables. Like most Kubernetes Resources, ConfigMaps are namespaced so only Pods in the same Namespace as a ConfigMap can use the ConfigMap.

In this Lab Step, you will see an example of how to create a ConfigMap from a literal key-value pair and mount the configuration data into a Pod using a volume.

### Instructions

1. Create a Namespace for the resources you'll create in this Lab Step and change your default `kubectl` context to use the Namespace:
```
# Create namespace  
kubectl create namespace configmaps  
# Set namespace as the default for the current context  
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=configmaps
```
2. Create a ConfigMap from two literal key-value pairs:
```
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=DB_NAME=testdb \  
  --from-literal=COLLECTION_NAME=messages

The command creates one ConfigMap named  `app-config` with two key-value pairs,  `DB_NAME=testdb`  and  `COLLECTION_NAME=messages`.
```
3. Display the ConfigMap:
```
kubectl get configmaps app-config -o yaml
```

This is also how you would declare an equivalent ConfigMap using a manifest file passed to  `kubectl create -f`.

4. Create a Pod that mounts the ConfigMap using a volume:
```
cat << 'EOF' > pod-configmap.yaml  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  name: db   
spec:  
  containers:  
  - image: mongo:4.0.6  
    name: mongodb  
    # Mount as volume   
    volumeMounts:  
    - name: config  
      mountPath: /config  
    ports:  
    - containerPort: 27017  
      protocol: TCP  
  volumes:  
  - name: config  
    # Declare the configMap to use for the volume  
    configMap:  
      name: app-config  
EOF  
kubectl create -f pod-configmap.yaml
```
The volume uses the  `configMap`  key to create a volume using a ConfigMap.

5. List the  `/config`  directory, where the ConfigMap volume is mounted, in the container:
```
kubectl exec db -it -- ls /config
```

The two ConfigMap keys are listed as files.

6. Get the contents of the DB_NAME file
```
kubectl exec db -it -- cat /config/DB_NAME && echo
```

The file content is the value of the corresponding ConfigMap key-value pair. The  `&& echo`  is added simply to put the shell prompt onto a new line.

7. View more examples of creating ConfigMaps by entering:
```
kubectl create configmap --help

### Summary

In this Lab Step, you created a ConfigMap and used it in a Pod by mounting it as a volume. ConfigMaps are useful for separating configuration from images to increase portability and reusability of container images. However, you should not store sensitive data in ConfigMaps. Instead, you should use Secrets, which are the topic of the next Lab Step.

You practiced using volumes to access ConfigMaps in Pods. To use a ConfigMap via Pod environment variables, you set the following field `pod.spec.containers.envFrom.configMapRef`  (issue `kubectl explain pod.spec.containers.envFrom.configMapRef`  for more details)
