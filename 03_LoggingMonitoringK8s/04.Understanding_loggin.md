### Introduction

Kubernetes has basic support for container logging built-in. Kubernetes will capture anything written to standard output and standard error as a log message. For logs that are not written to standard output, More effort is required. You can always copy log files in containers outside of the container or issue commands by running a shell in the container to retrieve the logs you need. You will see example of all of these approaches in this Lab Step. There is another common approach that you will see in the following Lab Step.

### Instructions

1. Create a Namespace for the resources you'll create in this Lab Step and change your default kubectl context to use the Namespace:
```
# Create namespace  
kubectl create namespace logs  
# Set namespace as the default for the current context  
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=logs
```

It is a best practice to use namespaces to logically organize your Kubernetes resources.

2. Create a multi-container Pod that runs a server and a client that sends requests to the server:
```
cat << 'EOF' > pod-logs.yaml  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  labels:  
    test: logs  
  name: pod-logs  
spec:  
  containers:  
  - name: server  
    image: busybox:1.30.1  
    ports:  
    - containerPort: 8888  
    # Listen on port 8888  
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]  
    # -v for verbose mode  
    args: ["nc -p 8888 -v -lke echo Received request"]  
    readinessProbe:  
      tcpSocket:  
        port: 8888  
  - name: client  
    image: busybox:1.30.1  
    # Send requests to server every 5 seconds  
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]  
    args: ["while true; do sleep 5; nc localhost 8888; done"]  
EOF  
kubectl create -f pod-logs.yaml
```

The  `server`  is similar to the one in the previous Lab Step except it includes the  `-v`  option for verbose output. This causes the  `server`  to write some text to standard output. The  `client` container uses  `nc`  as well, but instead of listening for connections on a port it connects to the  `server`.

3. Retrieve the logs (standard output messages) from the  `server`  container:
```
kubectl logs pod-logs server
```
![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid0-b7bdc7c9-c053-43be-9455-69828454512d.png)

After an initial  **listening**  message, connection messages for each  `client`  request are dislplayed. The arguments to the kubectl logs command are the pod followed by the specific container. If a Pod only has one container, the last argument can be omitted. Several examples are available in the logs help (`kubectl logs --help`).

4. Display the most recent log (`--tail=1`) including the timestamp and stream (`-f`  for follow) the logs from the  `client`  container:
```
kubectl logs -f --tail=1 --timestamps pod-logs client
```

You will see a new request being made every five seconds.

5. Press  _ctrl+c_  to stop streaming the logs.

6. Create an Apache web server and allow access to it via a load balancer:
```
cat << 'EOF' > pod-webserver.yaml  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  labels:  
    test: logs  
  name: webserver-logs  
spec:  
  containers:  
  - name: server  
    image: httpd:2.4.38-alpine  
    ports:  
    - containerPort: 80  
    readinessProbe:  
      httpGet:  
        path: /  
        port: 80  
EOF  
kubectl create -f pod-webserver.yaml  
kubectl expose pod webserver-logs --type=LoadBalancer
```

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid3-815245a7-22c7-434d-8792-b3011a1a2f8a.png)

The  `expose`  command uses the container port for the Service's port when the  `--port`  option isn't provided. In this case, the Service uses port 80 (HTTP).

7. Watch the output of get services until the **EXTERNAL-IP** column has a DNS address:
```
watch kubectl get services
```

8. Copy the DNS address in the **External-IP** column and press _ctrl+c_ to quit watching the output.

9. Navigate to the DNS address in a new browser tab to confirm the Service has exposed the Pod over the Internet:

_Note_: If the page does not initially load, you may need to wait a minute or two until the load balancer completes its health checks and starts serving traffic to the Pods. Refresh the page every minute until the page loads.

10. Refresh the page a few times and then append /oops to the address to cause an **Not Found**  error:

11. Display the logs for the web server Pod:
```
kubectl logs webserver-logs
```
![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid8-529f3b04-57cd-4342-930c-41de46c77888.png)

The browser request logs, for example the  **GET /favicon.ico**  and **GET /oops**  requests, are mixed within the readiness probe requests. The httpd container directs access logs and errors to standard output and standard error, instead of the files as would be the case for non-containerized installations.

When working with legacy applications that are containerized, they may use files for logging rather than standard output and standard error. The next instructions demonstrate the commands you could use to access those types of logs.

12. Retrieve the last 10 lines from the  `conf/httpd.conf`  file:
```
kubectl exec webserver-logs -- tail -10 conf/httpd.conf
```
![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid9-035e0f37-b5cc-4e42-ae78-042bed726ffb.png)

The  `tail`  command with  `-10`  prints the last 10 lines of the given file. Although  `httpd.conf`  isn't a log file, you could use the command to access log files in the same way.

13. Copy the  `conf/httpd.conf` from the container to the bastion host:
```
kubectl cp webserver-logs:conf/httpd.conf local-copy-of-httpd.conf
```
The  `cp`  command takes a source file spec (`webserver-logs:conf/httpd.conf`) and a destination file spec (`local-copy-of-httpd.conf`). You can also copy from the local file system to a container using  `cp`. To indicate the Pod file system, begin the file spec with the Pod name followed by colon and then the path. There are several examples in the help if you ever forget the syntax (`kubectl cp --help`).

### Summary

In this Lab Step, you learned that Kubernetes logs any output written by containers to standard output and standard error and stores those messages as logs. For legacy applications, you can use  `exec`  or  `cp`  to access log files when standard output and standard error aren't in being used.
