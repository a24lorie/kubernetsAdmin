### Introduction

If a Pod is in a Running state it does not necessarily mean the Pod is ready to use or that the Pod is operating as you would expect. For example, a running Pod may not be ready to accept requests or may have entered into an internal failed state, such as a deadlock, preventing it to make progress on new requests. Kubernetes introduces readiness and liveness probes for containers to detect when Pods are in such states. More specifically:

-   Readiness probes are used to detect when a Pod is unable to serve traffic, such as during startup when large amounts of data are being loaded or caches are being warmed. When a readiness probe fails, it means that the Pod needs more time to become ready to serve traffic. When the Pod is accessed through a Kuberentes Service, the Service will not serve traffic to any Pods that have a failing readiness probe.
-   Liveness probes are used to detect when a Pod fails to make progress after entering a broken state, such as deadlock. The issues causing the Pod to enter such a broken state are bugs, but by detecting a Pod is in a broken state allows Kubernetes to restart the Pod and allow progress to be made, perhaps only temporarily until arriving at the broken state again. The application availability is improved compared to leaving the Pod in the broken state.

Both probes run for the entire lifetime of the container they are declared in. A container can define up to one of each type of probe. Both probes are also configured the same way. The only difference is how a probe failure is interpreted.

You will use both types of probes in this Lab Step.

### Instructions

1. Enter the following commands to secure copy the `kubectl` config from the master node using SSH agent forwarding, and enter _yes_ when prompted about the host's authentiticy:
```
# Get the IP address of the Kubernetes master using the AWS CLI  
master_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \  
  --region=us-west-2 \  
  --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=k8s-master" \  
  --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].PrivateIpAddress" \  
  --output text)  
# Securely copy the kubeonfig file  
scp -o "ForwardAgent yes" ubuntu@$master_ip:~/kubeconfig ~/.kube/config
```

`kubectl` is now ready to use and will automatically use the configuration located in `~/.kube/config`.

_Warning_![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid1-943414f9-121b-4fe0-b602-0949da35f956.png): If you receive an error message, the cluster may not be fully provisioned yet. Periodically re-issue the command every minute until it succeeds. You can check the EC2 Console's Instances view to see when all instances are in the **running** state.

2. Load `kubectl` shell completions for your current shell session:
```
source <(kubectl completion bash)
```
With completions loaded, you can press _tab_ to autocomplete or list available completions as you enter `kubectl` commands.

3. Explain the `readinessProbe`  field which is at the path  `pod.spec.containers.readinessProbe`:
```
kubectl explain pod.spec.containers.readinessProbe
```

Read through the **DESCRIPTION**  and **FIELDS**. There are three types of actions a probe can take to assess the readiness of a Pod's container:

-   `exec`: Issue a command in the container. If the exit code is zero the container is a success, otherwise it is a failed probe.
-   `httpGet`: Send and HTTP GET request to the container at a specified path and port. If the HTTP response status code is a 2xx or 3xx then the container is a success, otherwise it is a failure.
-   `tcpSocket`: Attempt to open a socket to the container on a specified port. If the connection cannot be established, the probe fails.

The number of consecurtive successes is configured via the  `successThreshold`  field, and the number of consecutive failures required to tranisition from success to failure is  `failureThreshold`. The probe runs every  `periodSeconds`  and each probe will wait up to  `timeoutSeconds` to complete.

4. Create a Pod that uses a readinessProbe with an HTTP GET action:
```
cat << 'EOF' > pod-readiness.yaml  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  labels:  
    test: readiness  
  name: readiness-http  
spec:  
  containers:  
  - name: readiness  
    image: httpd:2.4.38-alpine  
    ports:  
    - containerPort: 80  
    # Sleep for 30 seconds before starting the server  
    command: ["/bin/sh","-c"]  
    args: ["sleep 30 && httpd-foreground"]  
    readinessProbe:  
      httpGet:  
        path: /  
        port: 80  
      initialDelaySeconds: 3  
      periodSeconds: 3  
EOF  
kubectl create -f pod-readiness.yaml
```
![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid0-cb942adf-9c98-43e0-bf11-4ecf49ab39f3.png)

The probe will check for a successful HTTP response from the Pod's IP on port 80. The container command delays starting the server by sleeping for 30 seconds to simulate an intense startup routine. You can also set custom HTTP headers for the probe, issue `kubectl explain pod.spec.containers.readinessProbe.httpGet`  for details.

5. Describe the Pod to see how events related to the readiness probe:
```
kubectl describe pod readiness-http
```
In the **Events**  you should see some **Warning**  entries related to the failed probe:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid0-b5669aa6-81a7-4683-91c6-35e66f735f94.png)

There will be about 10 (**x10**) failed probes since the container sleeps for 30 seconds and the probe runs every 3 seconds after an initial 3 second delay. You can see when the succeeds by looking at the **Conditions**  section:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid1-65f23c29-0422-4a7e-9d73-fd300b573f2c.png)

The **Ready** and **ContainerReady** **Status**  will both be **True**  once the probe succeeds. They will be **False**  until then. Also note the **Containers**  section summarizes the configured readiness probe:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid2-8f1aecb9-bbf8-4ed9-aa93-98ad8f62cf98.png)

6. To confirm the readiness probes are always running, kill the  `httpd`  server processes running in the container
```
kubectl exec readiness-http -- pkill httpd
```
This command runs  `pkill httpd`  (kill all  `httpd`  processes) inside the  `readiness-http`  Pod's only container. The two dashes (`--`) are used to indicate where the command to run begins and options parsing for  `kubectl exec`  ends.

7. Describe the Pod and observe the  **Ready Conditions**  are  **False**:
```
kubectl describe pod readiness-http
```
![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid1-61affea0-0fe8-41ef-a7e3-d3716ed8441b.png)

_Note_: The httpd server processes will recover from being killed after minute. If more than a minute has passed since you issued the previous instruction's command, you may see both conditions are **True**. If that happened, you can kill the httpd processes again and quickly describe the Pod.

8. Create a Pod that uses a liveness probe to detect broken states:
```
cat << 'EOF' > pod-liveness.yaml  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  labels:  
    test: liveness  
  name: liveness-tcp  
spec:  
  containers:  
  - name: liveness  
    image: busybox:1.30.1  
    ports:  
    - containerPort: 8888  
    # Listen on port 8888 for 30 seconds, then sleep  
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]  
    args: ["timeout 30 nc -p 8888 -lke echo hi && sleep 600"]  
    livenessProbe:  
      tcpSocket:  
        port: 8888  
      initialDelaySeconds: 3  
      periodSeconds: 5  
EOF  
kubectl create -f pod-liveness.yaml
```
Recall that liveness probes have the same configuration as readiness probes. The  `nc`  (netcat) command listens (the  `-l`  option) for connections on port (`-p`)  `8888`  and responds with the message  `hi`  for the first 30 seconds, after which  `timeout`  kills the  `nc`  server. The liveness probe attempts to establish a connection with the server every 5 seconds.

9. Watch the describe output for the Pod to observe when the liveness probe fails and the Pod is restarted:
```
watch kubectl describe pod liveness-tcp
```
The **Events**  will list **BackOff**  and **Unhealthy**  events when the liveness probe fails. Over time you should see the **Restart Count**  increment about every minute:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid2-6b2ba6e0-4ef8-4f72-8afb-6824e574d45b.png)

Recall that the the probe needs to fail three times after having success to consider the probe as failed.

10. Press  _ctrl+c_ to stop watching the output.

11. Delete the Pods created in this Lab Step:
```
kubectl delete -f pod-readiness.yaml  
kubectl delete -f pod-liveness.yaml
```

### Summary

In this Lab Step, you understood the purpose of and learned how to use both readiness and liveness probes. Readiness probes allow you to detect when a Pod is not ready to serve traffic and Kubernetes should wait longer for the Pod to become ready. Liveness probes allow you to detect when a Pod has entered a broken state and is restarted automatically.
