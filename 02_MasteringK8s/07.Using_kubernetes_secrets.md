### Introduction

Kubernetes provides Secrets as a way of storing sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys. Secrets reduce the risk of accidental exposure compared to if they were stored in an image or put in a Pod specification. Kubernetes supports storing Secrets as generic key-value pairs, and also provides specialized support for TLS certificate secrets and Docker registry secrets used for pulling images from registries that require authentication. This Lab Step focuses on the generic variety of Secrets.

Secrets are very similar to ConfigMaps with the main difference being their intent, i.e. Secrets store sensitive information and ConfigMaps should store configuraiton data. Secrets are not encrypted at rest by default and are instead only base-64 encoded. However, Kubernetes can separately control access to ConfigMaps and Secrets. So by following the pattern of storing sensitive data in Secrets, users of the cluster can be denied access to Secrets but granted access to ConfigMaps using Kubernetes access control mechanisms.

In this Lab Step, you will create a new secret and use it in a Pod through environment variables.

### Instructions

1. Create a Namespace for the resources you'll create in this Lab Step and change your default `kubectl` context to use the Namespace:
```
# Create namespace  
kubectl create namespace secrets  
# Set namespace as the default for the current context  
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=secrets
```
2. Use  `kubectl`  to create a Secret named  `app-secret`:
```
kubectl create secret generic app-secret --from-literal=password=123457
```
The generic key-value pair Secret is assigned using the `--from-literal` option with an equal sign separating the key (`our-secret`) from the value (`almost finished`). You can see `kubectl create secret generic --help` for other methods and examples for creating generic secrets.

3. Get the YAML output for the Secret you created:
```
kubectl get secret app-secret -o yaml
```

The **data** field holds all of the key-value pairs. In this case, there is only one. The key **password** appears as expected, but the value (**MTIzNDU3**) is far from "123457". That is because secret values are base-64 encoded.

_Note_: When you use `kubectl create secret`, the value is automatically encoded. If you use `kubectl create -`f, and specify a resource file, you need to encode the value yourself. See the next instruction for how to achieve this.

4. Confirm the secret value is base-64 encoded by decoding it:
```
kubectl get secret app-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" \  
  | base64 --decode \  
  && echo
```

The `base64` command can encode/decode strings. The `--decode` option must be specified to decode while the behavior with no options is to encode. The final `echo` is used to add a new line to the output so the shell prompt is on its own line.

5. Create a Pod that uses the Secret through an environment variable:
```
cat << EOF > pod-secret.yaml   
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Pod  
metadata:  
  name: pod-secret  
spec:  
  containers:  
  - image: busybox:1.30.1  
    name: busybox  
    args:  
    - sleep  
    - "3600"  
    env:  
    - name: PASSWORD      # Name of environment variable  
      valueFrom:  
        secretKeyRef:  
          name: app-secret  # Name of secret  
          key: password     # Name of secret key  
EOF  
  
kubectl create -f pod-secret.yaml
```
When using a secret through an environment variable, you must include `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` to specify the source of the environment variable.

6. Print the value of the environment variable in the Pod's container:
```
kubectl exec pod-secret -- /bin/sh -c 'echo $PASSWORD'
```

Notice that the value is base-64 decoded automatically, so there is no need to use `base64 --decode` inside the container.

### Summary

In this Lab Step, you learned about Kubernetes Secrets. You created a new Secret and accessed it inside of a container using an environment variable. You can also create secrets from files and mount Secrets using volumes just as you could with ConfigMaps.
