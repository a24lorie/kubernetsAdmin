### Introduction

`kubeadm` is a tool that allows you to easily create Kubernetes clusters that adhere to best practices. It can also perform a variety of cluster lifecycle functions, such as upgrading and downgrading the version of Kubernetes on nodes in the cluster. You will use  `kubeadm`  to create a Kubernetes cluster from scratch in this Lab. Creating clusters with `kubeadm`  is the recommended way for learning Kubernetes, creating small clusters, and as a piece of a more complex systems for more enterprise-ready clusters.

The Cloud Academy Lab environment includes three EC2 instances running the Ubuntu 16.04 distribution of Linux. You will configure the instance named **instance-a** as a Kubernetes master and the other instances as worker nodes in the cluster. In this Lab Step, you will install  `kubeadm`  and its dependencies, including Docker, on instance-a. The remaining nodes already been have  `kubeadm`  installed to save you time.

### Instructions

1. Enter the following command to update the system's apt package manager index and update packages required to install Docker:

# Update the package index
 ```
sudo apt-get update  
```

# Update packages required for HTTPS package repository access  
```
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

2. Install Docker community edition using Ubuntu's apt package manager and the official Docker repository:

# Add Dockerâ€™s GPG key  
```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -  
```

# Configure the stable Docker release repository 
 
```
sudo add-apt-repository \  
 "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \  
 $(lsb_release -cs) \  
 stable"  
```
 
# Update the package index to include the stable Docker repository
```
sudo apt-get update  
```

# Install Docker  
```
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce=17.03.2~ce-0~ubuntu-xenial
```

The installation instructions are based on [Docker's official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/). Although it is possible to install Ubuntu's docker.io package, to control the version and use a version that is officially supported by Kubernetes, Docker community edition 17.03 is installed directly from Docker's package repository.

3. Confirm Docker 17.03 is installed:
```
docker --version
```

4. Install  `kubeadm`,  `kubectl`, and  `kubelet`  from the official Kubernetes package repository:

# Add the Google Cloud packages GPG key  
```
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
# Add the Kubernetes release repository
```  
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main"  
```
# Update the package index to include the Kubernetes repository
```
sudo apt-get update  
```
# Install the packages
```
sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.13.4-00 kubelet=1.13.4-00 kubectl=1.13.4-00 kubernetes-cni=0.6.0-00  
```
# Prevent automatic updates to the installed packages
```
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```
The version of all the packages is set to 1.13.4 for consistency in Lab experiences, and so that you can perform a cluster upgrade in a later Lab Step.

5. Display the help page for kubeadm:
```
kubeadm
```

Read through the output to get a high-level overview of how a cluster is created and the commands that are available in  `kubeadm`.

### Summary

In this Lab Step, you installed  `kubeadm`  and its dependencies required for creating Kuberntes clusters.
