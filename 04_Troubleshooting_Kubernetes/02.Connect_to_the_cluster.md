### Introduction

In this Lab Step, you will employ a Secure Shell (SSH) client to connect to a remote Linux server with  **_SSH agent forwarding enabled_**. SSH agent forwarding allows your local SSH keys to be used to make connections from remote servers. This avoids the security risk of having your keys stored on a remote server. SSH agent forwarding is commonly used to connect to instances in a private subnet through a bastion host. Remember to use the user name  **ubuntu**  when connecting to the instance bastion host.

If not properly configured you will experience issues later on in the lab. For example,  in Windows the key must be added to Pageant.**

### Instructions

1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to **Services > Compute > EC2**:

2. Select the target virtual machine and locate the **IPv4 Public IP** address. An example IPv4 address number is 52.39.32.175. Copy your virtual machine IP address for later use:

_Note_: If you are connecting to an instance automatically created by the Cloud Academy Lab environment, it can take a few minutes to appear. If the instance is not visible, please refresh after a minute or two until it appears.

3. Proceed to the **Connecting using Linux/macOS** or **Connecting using Windows** instructions depending on your local operating system.

### Connecting using Linux/macOS

Linux distributions and macOS include an SSH client that accepts standard PEM keys. Complete the following steps to connect using the included terminal applications:

a. Download the  **PEM**  key  **Credentials** section in the upper-left corner of this lab:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid1-be259222-1a8d-4738-9638-c41825a1155a.png)

b. Open your terminal application.

If you need assistance finding the terminal application, search for "terminal" using your operating system's application finder or search commands.

c. Enter the following to make sure the read-only permissions are correct on the PEM key file:
```
chmod 400 /Path/To/Your/KeyPair.pem
```
d. Enter the following command to add private keys to the authentication agent:
```
ssh-add -k /_Path_/_To_/_Your_/_KeyPair._pem
```
e. Issue the following command to connect to the remote host using SSH:
```
ssh -A _AMIUserName_@_YourIPv4Address_
```
where the command details are:

-   `ssh`  initiates the SSH connection.
-   `-A`  specifies to use agent forwarding.
-   _AMIUserName_ specifies the SSH user:
    -   For the Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image (AMI), a standard SSH user is ec2-user.
    -   For Ubuntu images, a standard SSH user is ubuntu.
    -   For CentOS images, a standard SSH user is centos.
    -   For Debian images, a standard SSH user is admin.
    -   For Red Hat 6.4 and later images, a standard SSH user is ec2-user.
-   _YourIPv4Address_ is the IPv4 address noted earlier in the instructions.

f. After successfully connecting to the virtual machine, you should reach a terminal prompt similar to the one shown in the following image:

_Note_: If you receive a warning that the host is unknown, enter  _y_  or  _yes_  to add the host and complete the connection.

### Connecting using Windows

a. If you do not have PuTTY and Pageant installed on your system, download and install the latest PuTTY MSI (Windows Installer) at [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html):

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid2-d47289b5-43f2-44bc-8ba9-2222bb4f17b6.png)

Windows does not include an SSH client. You must download an application that includes one. A free and useful utility is called PuTTY. PuTTY supports SSH connections as well as key generation and conversion. The PuTTY package also includes Pageant. Pageant is an SSH authentication agent that enables agent forwarding on Windows.

b. Download the **PPK** key **Credentials** section in the upper-left corner of this lab:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid3-3234a018-cd47-4b72-8fa2-e4f7c47108b8.png)

c. In the Windows search box enter p_ageant_  and click the **Pageant App**  result:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid12-9f7dde0e-f0b9-4325-b589-c31c6b6cbc9a.png)

Alternatively, you can enter  _pageant_  into a command prompt terminal to start Pageant.

Note that Pageant runs as a Windows service. It should be displayed in your Windows task tray, but could be "hidden". Hence, you may need to "show hidden icons". Pageant is displayed as a terminal with a hat on it:

d. Right-click the Pageant icon and select **Add Key**:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid6-f83fb74c-a96f-41b8-99b1-2e39c8709bcc.png)

e. Browse to the PPK key file you downloaded earlier and click  **Open**:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid10-dfe62397-98fe-492a-a72a-3e96d248459a.png)

With the key added to Pageant, it is now available for use with agent forwarding. You can verify the key is added by right-clicking the Pageant icon and selecting **View Keys**:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid11-ac3a4137-95d2-492a-8fad-189049014743.png)

f. Open PuTTY and insert the IPv4 public IP address in the **Host Name (or IP address)** field:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid8-b7b9cff0-0e27-439d-a31a-69e4a0591c30.png)

g. Navigate to the **Connection > SSH > Auth** section. Select the  **Allow agent forwarding** and click **Open**:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid1-a4c30ebc-021c-4b9d-9430-887814ea7569.png)

You  **do not**  need to browse to the key  because the key is already available through Pageant which has the key added and available for forwarding.

h. Wait several seconds for the authentication prompt and click  **Yes** in the  **PuTTY Security Alert** to acknowledge you trust the host:

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid0-4ee67840-d2ca-4a6e-9582-0e82cc39081c.png)

i. Enter the SSH user name for the virtual machine operating system, such as ec2-user for Amazon Linux, and press **Enter**.

Additional example SSH user names include:

-   For Amazon Linux, a standard SSH user is ec2-user.
-   For Ubuntu images, a standard SSH user is ubuntu.
-   For CentOS images, a standard SSH user is centos.
-   For Debian images, a standard SSH user is admin.
-   For Red Hat 6.4 and later images, a standard SSH user is ec2-user.

j. To verify the SSH connection was made using agent forwarding, enter:

env | grep SSH_AUTH_SOCK 

![alt](https://assets.cloudacademy.com/bakery/media/uploads/blobid1-b39935d4-a022-4148-9390-3905927ecaca.png)

If there is no output, the connection was made without using agent forwarding. If that is the case, perform the instructions again to ensure each one is performed correctly.

### Summary

In this Lab Step, you connected to a virtual machine using an SSH client with SSH agent forwarding enabled.
