### Introduction

The process of adding a worker node with  `kubeadm`  is even simpler than initializing a master node. You will join a worker node to the cluster using the command that  `kubeadm init`  provided in this Lab Step.

### Instructions

1. Open a second terminal connected to  **instance-b** that is listed in the EC2 Console.

Refer back to the earlier Lab Step on connecting to instance-a using SSH, if required. The SSH user name is again  _ubuntu_.

2. Enter  `sudo`  followed by the  `kubeadm join`  command that you stored from the output of  `kubeadm init`. It resembles:

```
sudo kubeadm join 10.0.0.###:6443 --token ... --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:...
```

Read through the output to understand the operations  `kubeadm`  performed.

3. In the master node's SSH shell, confirm the worker node is part of the cluster:
```
kubectl get nodes
```

The worker node appears with a role of **<none>**.

4. Confirm that all the pods in the cluster are running:
```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

All of the pods are **Running**, and the two-node cluster is operational. Notice that there are two  **calico-node**  pods that support pod networking on each node.

### Summary

In this Lab Step, you joined a worker node to the cluster using  `kubeadm join`.
